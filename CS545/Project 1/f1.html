    	Pasteis de nata, a kind of custard tart, are as pervasive in Lisbon as bagels are 
    	in Manhattan. The only place to go for the original, though, is the Antiga 
    	Confeitaria de Belem, a tile-decorated bakery on the western edge of the city, 
    	where they are known as Pasteis de Belem. Often dusted with cinnamon and powdered 
    	sugar, Pastéis de Belém are made from a secret recipe the current establishment 
    	guards far more carefully than the church baker who sold it to them almost 200 
    	years ago. Most people order them to go, often after waiting in lines that stretch 
    	out the door. But these soft-in-the-center sweets go best with coffee, and you'll 
    	want the time to nibble at them, still warm from the oven, in one of the bakery’s 
    	serving rooms.

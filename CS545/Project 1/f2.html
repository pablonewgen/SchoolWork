    	The Portuguese national dish, bacalhau, or salt cod, has its origins on the Grand 
    	Banks of the North Atlantic, where the Portuguese once played a major role in 
    	manning the fishing boats. A flavorful fish, to say the least, there are 
    	supposedly at least 365 ways to prepare it, including the 25 served up at the 
    	vault-ceilinged Casa do Bacalhau, said to be in the former stables of a duke’s 
    	palace in the eastern part of Lisbon. It’s difficult to find any Lisbon restaurant 
    	that doesn’t serve some form of it—the most popular is probably bacalhau a bras, 
    	a stir fry of cod, rice, scrambled eggs, and onions, garnished with black olives.

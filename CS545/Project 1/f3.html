    	Rivaling bacalhau for status as a national dish, this green soup could almost be 
    	called soulful, as it is often served in Lisbon nightclubs where you’ll hear fado, 
    	a traditional form of musical expression heavily laden with longing and lament. 
    	The basics of the brothy mix are cabbage, onions, and thin-sliced potatoes, 
    	sometimes accompanied by chourico sausage. No need to feign crying over lost 
    	love to try it, as you’ll find it at the many restaurants in Lisbon that specialize 
    	in dishes from the Minho province of northern Portugal, where caldo verde 
    	originated. Or spoon into it at one of the fado clubs, such as Pateo de Alfama, 
    	where it will be part of the meal accompanying the show.

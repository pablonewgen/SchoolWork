    	<h2> A Brief History </h2>
    	<p>
    	 Lisbon’s history dates back to 300,000 years ago. However, it emerged as a 
    	 nation state in the early 12th century and ranks as one of the world's longest 
    	 founded cities. As the legend tells, it is a city founded and named by Ulysses as
    	  Ulissipo or Olissopo, which has its origins in the Phoenician words 
    	  "Allis Ubbo", meaning "enchanting port".
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	The 15th century was the point of departure for the Portuguese Discoveries, an era
    	 during which Portugal enjoyed abundant wealth and prosperity through its newly 
    	 discovered off shore colonies in Atlantic islands, the shores of Africa, the 
    	 Americas and Asia. Vasco da Gama's famous discovery of the sea route to India 
    	 marked this century. Lisbon was then world's most prosperous trading centre. 
    	 Furthermore, many attractions of the city at present such as Mosteiro dos 
    	 Jerónimos and Torre de Belém, both classified by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites, 
    	 were built during this period.

    	However, this era didn’t take long: the earthquake of 1755 destroyed nearly entire
    	 city. The city was rebuilt by the Marquês de Pombal, who thus created the Baixa 
    	 Pombalina, a commercial area that still attains attraction. In the 19th and 20th 
    	 centuries, the city spread progressively to the North and areas such as the 
    	 Avenidas Novas (New Avenues) were added.
